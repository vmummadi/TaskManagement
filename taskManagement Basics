Yes, a **Task Management System** can be beneficial for handling lead status transitions effectively, especially when there are actions that need to be performed before a lead can progress to the next stage.  

---

## **1️⃣ When is a Task Management System Needed?**
A **Task Management System** becomes essential when:  
✅ **Manual Actions are Required** → e.g., "Follow-up call" must be completed before moving from **Contacted → Qualified**.  
✅ **Approval-based Transitions Exist** → e.g., a manager must approve moving to **Closed Won** if the deal value is high.  
✅ **Multi-Step Workflows Exist** → e.g., multiple tasks like "Schedule test drive" and "Send financing options" need to be completed before a transition.  
✅ **Auto-Generated Reminders & Assignments** → e.g., system-generated tasks for sales reps like "Follow up in 3 days."

## **2️⃣ How Task Management Works with Lead Status Transitions**
Each lead status change may **trigger a task**, and the lead **cannot move to the next status** until all required tasks are completed.

### **Example Workflow with Tasks**
| **Lead Status**  | **Required Tasks Before Transition** |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **New → Contacted**  | "Assign lead to sales rep" |
| **Contacted → Qualified** | "Make initial call", "Send introduction email" |
| **Qualified → Proposal Sent** | "Schedule test drive", "Check financing options" |
| **Proposal Sent → Closed Won** | "Obtain customer signature", "Manager approval" |

## **3️⃣ System Design for Task Management**
### **📌 Database Schema for Tasks**
```sql
CREATE TABLE LeadTasks (
    task_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    lead_id UUID REFERENCES Leads(lead_id),
    assigned_to UUID REFERENCES Users(user_id),
    task_name VARCHAR(255),
    status VARCHAR(50) CHECK (status IN ('Pending', 'Completed', 'Overdue')),
    due_date TIMESTAMP,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    completed_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### **📌 Task Lifecycle**
1️⃣ **Task Created** → When a lead reaches a certain status.  
2️⃣ **Task Assigned** → Assigned to a sales rep or manager.  
3️⃣ **Task Marked as Completed** → System updates task status.  
4️⃣ **Lead Can Transition** → Only when all required tasks are completed.  

---

## **4️⃣ API Design for Lead Tasks**

### **1️⃣ Get Pending Tasks for a Lead**
```http
GET /api/leads/{lead_id}/tasks
```
**Response:**
```json
[
    { "task_id": "123", "task_name": "Call lead", "status": "Pending", "assigned_to": "rep_1" },
    { "task_id": "124", "task_name": "Send email", "status": "Completed", "assigned_to": "rep_1" }
]
```

### **2️⃣ Mark a Task as Completed**
```http
PUT /api/tasks/{task_id}
{
    "status": "Completed"
}
```
**Response:**
```json
{ "success": true, "message": "Task completed" }
```

### **3️⃣ Check If Lead Can Transition**
```http
GET /api/leads/{lead_id}/can_transition
```
**Response:**
```json
{
    "current_status": "Contacted",
    "can_transition": false,
    "pending_tasks": ["Call lead"]
}
```

---

## **5️⃣ Automating Task Creation & Enforcement**
### **Automatically Create Tasks on Lead Status Change**
```java
public void createTasksForStatus(String leadId, String newStatus) {
    List<String> tasks = taskConfig.getTasksForStatus(newStatus);
    for (String task : tasks) {
        LeadTask leadTask = new LeadTask(leadId, task, "Pending");
        taskRepository.save(leadTask);
    }
}
```

### **Prevent Status Change Until Tasks Are Done**
```java
public boolean canLeadTransition(String leadId) {
    List<LeadTask> pendingTasks = taskRepository.getPendingTasksForLead(leadId);
    return pendingTasks.isEmpty();
}
```

---

## **6️⃣ UI Features for Task Management**
✅ **Kanban View for Tasks** → "Pending," "In Progress," "Completed."  
✅ **Automated Task Reminders** → Alert sales reps for overdue tasks.  
✅ **Manager Dashboard** → Track overdue tasks across leads.  
✅ **Mobile Notifications** → Remind sales reps to complete tasks.  

---

## **7️⃣ Benefits of Integrating Task Management**
✔ **Enforces Business Rules** → Prevents skipping crucial steps.  
✔ **Ensures Accountability** → Tracks who is responsible for each task.  
✔ **Automates Follow-ups** → Sales reps get notified about pending actions.  
✔ **Improves Lead Conversion** → Leads move smoothly through the pipeline.
