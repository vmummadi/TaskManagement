Each approach comes with its own potential drawbacks. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the key challenges you might face with each:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Parquet in S3 + DuckDB/Trino**  
‚úÖ **Pros Recap:** Cost-effective, scalable, optimized for batch analytics  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Potential Drawbacks:**  
| **Drawback**              | **Explanation** |
|--------------------------|----------------|
| **Data Freshness Delay** | Since Parquet files are immutable, new data requires metadata refresh (e.g., Iceberg/Hudi/Delta for versioning). If you need near real-time updates, this could be a bottleneck. |
| **Query Latency on Large Data** | While columnar storage improves query speed, query engines like Trino and DuckDB still require scanning large datasets, which can slow down performance for interactive queries. |
| **High Concurrency Limitations** | DuckDB is single-node and better suited for local queries, while Trino scales but requires additional coordination and worker nodes for high concurrency. |
| **Complex Window Aggregation Handling** | Trino supports window functions, but performance optimization requires partitioning strategies to avoid full table scans. |

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Parquet in S3 + Apache Pinot**  
‚úÖ **Pros Recap:** Near real-time analytics, optimized for OLAP queries  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Potential Drawbacks:**  
| **Drawback**              | **Explanation** |
|--------------------------|----------------|
| **Complex Ingestion Setup** | To achieve real-time ingestion, you need to integrate **Kafka or a streaming pipeline**, which adds operational overhead. Batch ingestion is easier but delays freshness. |
| **Higher Infrastructure Cost** | Pinot requires a **controller, broker, real-time servers, and storage nodes**, making it more expensive than Trino/DuckDB on S3. |
| **Operational Complexity** | Maintaining a **distributed system** like Pinot requires expertise in indexing, segment merging, and scaling storage nodes efficiently. |
| **Limited Flexibility for Joins** | Pinot is not optimized for complex joins (like Trino or RDS), so queries involving multiple datasets may need **denormalized tables or pre-aggregations**. |

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Materialized Views in RDS**  
‚úÖ **Pros Recap:** Simple setup, strong consistency, SQL-friendly  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Potential Drawbacks:**  
| **Drawback**              | **Explanation** |
|--------------------------|----------------|
| **Scaling Bottlenecks** | RDS is designed for transactional workloads (OLTP), so it doesn‚Äôt handle high-volume analytical queries well. Materialized views can become **slow and expensive** as data grows. |
| **Refresh Overhead** | Materialized views require **manual or scheduled refreshes**, which may introduce **staleness** unless an incremental strategy is used. |
| **Compute and Storage Costs** | Large materialized views with frequent updates put pressure on the database, requiring a **high-tier RDS instance**, increasing costs. |
| **Not Optimized for OLAP** | Even with indexing, materialized views are **not as performant as columnar storage** (like Parquet) for large-scale analytical queries. |

### **Summary of Drawbacks by Approach**
| **Approach**                 | **Main Concern** |
|------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Parquet in S3 + DuckDB/Trino** | **Data freshness and high query latency on large datasets** |
| **Parquet in S3 + Apache Pinot** | **High infrastructure and ingestion complexity** |
| **Materialized Views in RDS** | **Scalability and expensive refresh operations** |

---

### **Final Considerations**
- If you **need real-time analytics**, **Apache Pinot** is the best choice, but it comes at the cost of **higher complexity and infrastructure overhead**.
- If you **want a simple, cost-effective batch analytics solution**, **Trino/DuckDB on Parquet in S3** works well but might have **slower query performance for fresh data**.
- If **simplicity and transactional consistency** are priorities, **Materialized Views in RDS** can work, but **scalability and performance will be a challenge**.

Would you like a recommendation on **handling incremental updates** or **optimizing window aggregations** for any of these? üöÄ
