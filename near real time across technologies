Since your **data is read-only** and **new data is continuously loaded**, the key challenge is ensuring **efficient incremental updates and optimized window aggregations**. Here’s a breakdown of how to handle these for each approach:

---

## **1️⃣ Parquet in S3 + DuckDB/Trino (Batch Analytics)**
✅ **Best For:** Cost-effective analytics on large historical data (if freshness can tolerate minor delays)  
⚠️ **Challenges:** Query latency on large datasets, managing incremental updates  

### **Handling Incremental Updates**  
- **Use Apache Iceberg, Hudi, or Delta Lake**: These provide **ACID transactions**, schema evolution, and efficient metadata handling for Parquet files.
- **Partitioning & Compaction**:
  - Partition by **time-based columns** (e.g., `date` or `hour`) to enable **incremental updates**.
  - **Compaction strategies**:
    - Small files? Use **compaction jobs** to merge them into larger ones for better query performance.
    - Apache Hudi supports **merge-on-read** for near real-time updates.
- **Metadata Caching**: DuckDB and Trino perform full scans unless you **enable metadata caching** (Iceberg helps with this).

### **Optimizing Window Aggregations**
- **Precompute aggregations in S3**:  
  - Use **Apache Spark or Presto/Trino ETL jobs** to precompute **rolling windows** and store the results in **separate Parquet tables**.
- **Use Trino’s `WINDOW` functions**:  
  - Example: Compute **moving averages** for the last 7 days:
    ```sql
    SELECT 
      user_id, 
      event_date, 
      SUM(sales) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY event_date ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS rolling_sales
    FROM sales_data;
    ```
- **Leverage Query Federation**: If you need real-time external data, **federate queries across sources** using **Trino connectors**.

## **2️⃣ Parquet in S3 + Apache Pinot (Real-Time Analytics)**
✅ **Best For:** Low-latency, real-time aggregations on streaming data  
⚠️ **Challenges:** Complex ingestion setup, higher infrastructure costs  

### **Handling Incremental Updates**
- **Use Kafka for real-time ingestion**:
  - Kafka → Pinot’s real-time table allows **incremental writes** with near real-time availability.
  - If not using Kafka, use a **batch ingestion pipeline** (e.g., Spark, Flink) for periodic updates.
- **Star-tree Indexing for Fast Aggregations**:
  - Pinot supports **pre-aggregations via Star-tree indexing**, which can accelerate **group-bys and rollups**.
- **Retention Policies**:
  - Keep only recent data in **real-time tables** and periodically move older data to **offline tables** (backed by Parquet in S3).

### **Optimizing Window Aggregations**
- **Use Roll-up Tables**:
  - Define **pre-aggregated Pinot tables** for common window queries (e.g., `1-hour`, `24-hour`, `7-day` aggregations).
- **Use Time-Based Partitioning**:
  - Create **time-partitioned segments** in Pinot to optimize window functions.
  - Example of a **7-day rolling sum**:
    ```sql
    SELECT
      user_id,
      event_time,
      SUM(sales) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY event_time RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL '7' DAY PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS rolling_sales
    FROM pinot_sales_table;
    ```
- **Hybrid Table Approach**:
  - Use **real-time Pinot tables for fresh data** (last few days).
  - Query **offline Pinot tables (S3-backed)** for historical data.
  - Combine results via **query-time joins**.

## **3️⃣ Materialized Views in RDS (Small-Scale Aggregates)**
✅ **Best For:** Small-scale, transactional aggregations (not recommended for high-scale analytics)  
⚠️ **Challenges:** Scalability, refresh overhead  

### **Handling Incremental Updates**
- **Use Incremental Refresh Strategy**:
  - Instead of `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW`, use **incremental refresh** via triggers or scheduled jobs.
  - Example:  
    ```sql
    CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_sales AS 
    SELECT 
      user_id, 
      event_date, 
      SUM(sales) AS total_sales 
    FROM sales_table 
    WHERE event_date > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
    GROUP BY user_id, event_date;
    ```
  - **Refresh only the new data**:
    ```sql
    REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_sales WITH DATA;
    ```
- **Use Indexed Views**:
  - Create indexes on frequently queried columns to speed up aggregations.

### **Optimizing Window Aggregations**
- **Use Window Functions with Indexing**:
  ```sql
  SELECT 
    user_id, 
    event_date, 
    SUM(sales) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY event_date ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS rolling_sales
  FROM mv_sales;
  ```
- **Partitioned Tables for Efficient Aggregations**:
  - Instead of one huge materialized view, **partition by time** (e.g., daily partitions) and aggregate across partitions.
