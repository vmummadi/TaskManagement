Your current schema is focused on **time-based reminders** (e.g., reminders sent at specific intervals like daily, alternate days, etc.). However, if you want to support **other types of triggers** for sending reminders, you need a more **extensible schema**.  

---

## **üîπ Extending the Schema for Other Reminder Triggers**
Instead of limiting reminders to only time-based triggers, you could introduce **a more generic trigger system**, allowing for **multiple types of conditions** to be configured dynamically.  

### **üìå Key Enhancements**
1. **Introduce a `reminder_trigger` table** to define different reminder triggers.
2. **Extend `reminder_rule` to reference different types of triggers**, not just time-based ones.
3. **Modify the reminder job to check which trigger applies for sending reminders.**

---

## **üìå Database Design Update**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ New Table: `reminder_trigger`**
Defines different types of triggers for reminders.

| Column Name     | Data Type    | Description |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| `trigger_id`   | UUID (PK)    | Unique identifier for the trigger |
| `dealer_id`    | UUID (FK)    | Foreign key to `dealer` (each dealer can define their own triggers) |
| `trigger_type` | ENUM ('TIME_BASED', 'NO_RESPONSE', 'CUSTOM_CONDITION') | Defines the type of trigger |
| `trigger_details` | JSONB      | Stores trigger-specific configurations (e.g., conditions) |
| `created_at`   | TIMESTAMP    | Timestamp of trigger creation |

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Update: `reminder_rule`**
Modify `reminder_rule` to link to `reminder_trigger` instead of only `reminder_schedule`.

| Column Name     | Data Type    | Description |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| `rule_id`      | UUID (PK)    | Unique identifier for the reminder rule |
| `trigger_id`   | UUID (FK)    | Foreign key to `reminder_trigger` (what condition must be met?) |
| `task_template_id` | UUID (FK) | Foreign key to `task_template` (which task does this rule apply to?) |
| `start_day`    | INT          | When this rule starts (for time-based triggers) |
| `end_day`      | INT          | When this rule ends (for time-based triggers) |
| `interval_days` | INT         | Frequency of reminders (if applicable) |
| `created_at`   | TIMESTAMP    | Timestamp of rule creation |

---

## **üîπ How This Enables New Reminder Triggers**
With this approach, reminders can now be triggered by **various conditions**, such as:

1. **Time-Based Triggers** (same as before)
   - Every X days, send reminders.
   
2. **No Response Triggers**  
   - If the lead has not responded within Y days, send a reminder.
   
3. **Custom Condition Triggers**  
   - Example: Send a reminder **if the lead viewed a proposal but did not sign it**.  

Since **`reminder_trigger.trigger_details`** is stored as **JSONB**, we can store **custom conditions** dynamically per dealer.

## **üìå Example Reminder Trigger Configurations**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Time-Based Reminder (Daily, Alternate Days, Weekly)**
```json
{
    "trigger_type": "TIME_BASED",
    "interval_days": [1, 2, 7]
}
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ No Response Reminder (Trigger if No Action in 3 Days)**
```json
{
    "trigger_type": "NO_RESPONSE",
    "days_without_response": 3
}
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Custom Reminder (Trigger if Proposal Viewed but Not Signed)**
```json
{
    "trigger_type": "CUSTOM_CONDITION",
    "condition": "proposal_viewed AND NOT proposal_signed"
}
```

---

## **üîπ Implementation in Java**
### **Checking Trigger Type in Java Reminder Job**
```java
public void processReminders() {
    List<ReminderRule> pendingReminders = reminderRuleRepository.getPendingReminders();

    for (ReminderRule rule : pendingReminders) {
        ReminderTrigger trigger = rule.getTrigger();

        switch (trigger.getTriggerType()) {
            case "TIME_BASED":
                if (isTimeToSendReminder(rule)) {
                    sendReminder(rule);
                }
                break;

            case "NO_RESPONSE":
                if (isNoResponseConditionMet(trigger)) {
                    sendReminder(rule);
                }
                break;

            case "CUSTOM_CONDITION":
                if (isCustomConditionMet(trigger)) {
                    sendReminder(rule);
                }
                break;
        }
    }
}
```

## **üîπ Summary**
‚úÖ **Supports Time-Based, No Response, and Custom Condition Triggers**  
‚úÖ **Allows Dealers to Configure Custom Triggers Dynamically**  
‚úÖ **Stores Conditions in JSONB for Flexibility**  
‚úÖ **Reminder Job Checks the Appropriate Trigger Type**  

Would you like me to extend this with more advanced filtering logic for processing reminders? üöÄ
