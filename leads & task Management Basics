### **Designing a "Lead Tracking & Status Management" System**  

A **Lead Tracking & Status Management** system should provide a structured way to track, update, and monitor leads through different stages of the sales funnel while ensuring seamless interaction for sales teams. Below is a **high-level design** considering system components, data model, workflows, and architecture.  

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ System Components & Functional Requirements**  
### **Core Functionalities:**  
‚úÖ **Lead Status Management** ‚Üí Define and transition leads through statuses (e.g., New, Contacted, Follow-up, Test Drive, Proposal Sent, Won/Lost).  
‚úÖ **Activity Logging** ‚Üí Track every interaction (calls, emails, meetings).  
‚úÖ **Assignment & Ownership** ‚Üí Assign leads to specific sales reps or auto-reassign based on availability.  
‚úÖ **Notifications & Reminders** ‚Üí Notify sales teams about upcoming actions (e.g., follow-ups, test drives).  
‚úÖ **Lead History & Audit Logs** ‚Üí Maintain a record of status changes and interactions.  
‚úÖ **Reports & Dashboards** ‚Üí Provide insights on lead movement and conversions.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Model Design**  
### **Entities & Relationships**  

```sql
CREATE TABLE Leads (
    lead_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id UUID NOT NULL,
    source VARCHAR(50),  -- Website, Social Media, Referral, etc.
    status VARCHAR(20) CHECK (status IN ('New', 'Contacted', 'Qualified', 'Test Drive', 'Proposal Sent', 'Closed - Won', 'Closed - Lost')),
    assigned_to UUID REFERENCES Users(user_id), -- Sales Rep
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE LeadStatusHistory (
    history_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    lead_id UUID REFERENCES Leads(lead_id),
    previous_status VARCHAR(20),
    new_status VARCHAR(20),
    changed_by UUID REFERENCES Users(user_id),
    changed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    comments TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE LeadActivities (
    activity_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    lead_id UUID REFERENCES Leads(lead_id),
    activity_type VARCHAR(50),  -- Call, Email, Meeting, SMS, Test Drive
    activity_details TEXT,
    activity_time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    performed_by UUID REFERENCES Users(user_id)
);
```

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Workflow & Status Transitions**  
A lead should progress through predefined states, ensuring sales reps follow an optimal engagement process.

### **Lead Status Flow Diagram**
```
[New] ‚Üí [Contacted] ‚Üí [Qualified] ‚Üí [Test Drive] ‚Üí [Proposal Sent] ‚Üí [Closed - Won]
                            ‚Üò [Closed - Lost]  
```

### **Status Transition Rules**
| Current Status     | Allowed Next Statuses |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| New               | Contacted, Closed - Lost |
| Contacted         | Qualified, Closed - Lost |
| Qualified        | Test Drive, Proposal Sent, Closed - Lost |
| Test Drive        | Proposal Sent, Closed - Lost |
| Proposal Sent     | Closed - Won, Closed - Lost |
| Closed - Won      | (Final State) |
| Closed - Lost     | (Final State) |

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ API Design (RESTful APIs)**
### **1. Create a New Lead**
```http
POST /api/leads
{
    "customer_id": "12345",
    "source": "Website",
    "assigned_to": "sales_rep_1"
}
```

### **2. Update Lead Status**
```http
PUT /api/leads/{lead_id}/status
{
    "new_status": "Qualified",
    "changed_by": "sales_manager",
    "comments": "Customer interested, awaiting test drive scheduling"
}
```

### **3. Log a Lead Activity**
```http
POST /api/leads/{lead_id}/activities
{
    "activity_type": "Call",
    "activity_details": "Spoke to customer, requested test drive for Monday",
    "performed_by": "sales_rep_1"
}
```

### **4. Fetch Lead Details with Status History**
```http
GET /api/leads/{lead_id}
```

### **5. Fetch Leads by Status**
```http
GET /api/leads?status=Contacted
```

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Architecture Design**  
### **Tech Stack Choices**
- **Backend:** Java (Spring Boot) / Python (FastAPI)  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (with JSONB for flexibility), Redis (for caching)  
- **Frontend:** React / Angular (for Sales Dashboard)  
- **Messaging:** Kafka / SQS (for event-based updates)  
- **Authentication:** Auth0 / OAuth2 for user management  

### **System Architecture Diagram**  
```
[Frontend (React, Angular)]  ‚Üí  [Backend (Spring Boot / FastAPI)]  ‚Üí  [PostgreSQL DB]
                                              ‚Üò  
                                         [Redis Cache]  
                                              ‚Üò  
                                          [Kafka Events]  ‚Üí [Email / SMS Service]  
```

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Lead Tracking Dashboard (UI Features)**
A user-friendly UI should provide:  
‚úÖ **Kanban View of Leads by Status**  
‚úÖ **Filters by Source, Status, Assigned Sales Rep**  
‚úÖ **Timeline View for Lead Activity**  
‚úÖ **Quick Actions (Call, Email, Test Drive Scheduling)**  
‚úÖ **Automated Follow-up Reminders**  

---

## **7Ô∏è‚É£ Event-Driven Automation (Enhancements)**
- **Auto-Reminders:** If a lead is "Contacted" but no update in 3 days ‚Üí Auto-reminder for follow-up.  
- **Escalations:** If a lead is not assigned within 24 hours ‚Üí Escalate to manager.  
- **Lead Score Calculation:** Assign a score based on engagement (e.g., frequent calls = higher priority).  
- **Predictive Analytics:** Use ML models to predict lead conversion probability.  

---

## **Final Thoughts**
This design ensures:  
‚úî **Scalability** ‚Üí Optimized DB schema & caching for fast retrieval.  
‚úî **Automation** ‚Üí Reduce manual tracking with smart workflows.  
‚úî **Transparency** ‚Üí Every status change & interaction is logged.  
‚úî **Sales Efficiency** ‚Üí Helps prioritize leads with analytics-driven insights.
