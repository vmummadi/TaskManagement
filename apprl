## 💪 **Top 4 Competency Strengths**

### 1. **Problem Solving — Above Benchmark**  
Demonstrated strong systems thinking and architectural foresight, as seen in the Task DB and Gen3 migration. Feedback confirms your ability to navigate complexity, anticipate blockers, and guide the team through creative, scalable solutions.

### 2. **Influence — Above Benchmark**  
Earned trust from cross-functional partners and product stakeholders through structured communication, solution clarity, and driving consensus across teams. Your horizontal API coaching directly reduced churn and enabled quicker platform alignment.

### 3. **Teamwork — Above Benchmark**  
Played a critical role in team ramp-up and horizontal support. Created a safe, collaborative space for junior teammates, and remained hands-on across multiple workstreams. Your leadership presence elevated the team’s overall delivery quality.

### 4. **Results Focus — At Benchmark**  
Stayed heads-down to drive two foundational initiatives (Task Management and Gen3), delivering them at high quality. Prioritized team unblock, scalability, and reliability, resulting in consistent, measurable outcomes.

---

## 📈 **Opportunities for Growth**

### 1. **Communication — At Benchmark**  
While highly effective within the immediate team and partners, there's an opportunity to elevate broader storytelling and influence at the leadership layer. Given the delivery focus this cycle, scope for broader narrative shaping was limited — unlocking this will increase strategic visibility.

### 2. **Problem Solving — At Benchmark**  
Although strong in applied contexts (as echoed in peer feedback), broader problem-solving scope was inherently constrained by the delivery-oriented focus this cycle. Tapping into more exploratory or ambiguous problem spaces could further stretch this muscle and broaden impact.

> 🧭 *Important Context*: These areas were not under-leveraged due to performance, but by **intentional focus on deep system architecture and delivery**. As scope widens beyond foundational build-outs, both areas are expected to grow further.

---

## 📎 **Supporting Evidence & Feedback**

- "The task team would not have been able to problem solve and move as quickly without you." – *Nidhi Pandya*  
- "You go above and beyond in supporting your team members and have an impressive ability to think of all possible edge cases."  
- "You are highly communicative with me, even while working across multiple workstreams."  
- Platform and horizontal teams highlighted smoother API reviews and integrations due to proactive coaching.  
- Task system praised for being **future-ready**, **scalable**, and enabling **rapid feature rollout**.

Absolutely — here’s a **2-minute spoken version** your manager can use when presenting your performance in a skip-level or calibration setting:

---

> “I’d like to highlight Vikas, who’s made a significant impact this cycle despite being relatively new to both the team and domain. One of his standout contributions was designing and delivering the architecture for the Task Management system — a foundational component that’s now enabling team velocity. He didn’t just deliver design; he stress-tested it for scale, built in resiliency, and made sure we were production-ready from the start.
>
> On top of that, he led the Gen3 migration for Intelligent Inventory — making it the **first system in production** on the Gen3 platform across Navigator. That’s a major unlock for other teams and a reflection of his ability to operate both at depth and at scale.
>
> He’s also been incredibly team-oriented. He established shared artifacts and a working platform that helped everyone stay aligned and productive. And in his role as API coach, he made sure platform integrations were compliant **before** reaching the review stage — reducing churn and helping the horizontal move faster.
>
> One of the things I hear most consistently from peers is that Vikas brings calm, structured thinking and elevates the quality of what we deliver by proactively identifying edge cases. He’s also deeply collaborative, always engaging with Product and peers to land the right scope and direction.
>
> If I had to call out opportunities, they’re less about gaps and more about **untapped potential** — this cycle was heavily heads-down due to the nature of the work, so communication reach and creative problem-solving outside of his lane were limited. But the foundation is solid, and I expect those to grow as his scope broadens.”
